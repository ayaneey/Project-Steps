# Progress-Steps

## Description

In this mini-project, I was able to create a progress bar that starts at button 1 that will go to the next button and so forth. Once you get to the end, the 'next' button will be disabled.

## What I learned ðŸ“–:

From this mini-project, I was able to gain an understanding of how to essentially buttons effectively, but more so how to 'disable' them in their functionalities for instance, stopping the user from clicking on the 'next button'.
